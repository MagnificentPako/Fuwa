# Fuwa

Fuwa is a WIP Discord library for ComputerCraft written in Urn. The name is japanese, and one of the many translations for "fuwa" is "discord".

## Getting Started

First of all you need Urn installed. The build script assumes that you have an executable called `urn` available, which can be achieved by adding a file containing something like this, with a changed path.
```sh
#!/usr/bin/bash
lua /home/paul/doc/bin/urn/bin/urn.lua $@
```

### Prerequisites

You need CCTweaks installed, which either comes as a mod if you run CC in Minecraft, or packaged with CCEmuX if you are on the emulator side.

### Installing

WIP.

## Running the tests

Tests are for the weak.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
